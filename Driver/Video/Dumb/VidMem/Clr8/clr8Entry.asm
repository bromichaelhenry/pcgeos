SYNOPSIS:	Execute some escape function

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL

PASS:		di	- escape code (ORed with 8000h)

RETURN:		di	- set to 0 if escape not supported
			- return unchanged if handled

DESTROYED:	see individual functions

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		scan through the table, find the code, call the handler.

SYNOPSIS:	A utility routine that calculates some variables about the
		bitmap and returns

CALLED BY:	DriverStrategy
PASS:		es	- locked window

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		calc values and place them in a shared memory space (in dgroup)
		This routine also P's a semaphore to protect those variables, 
		which is later V'd in the Mono module before the mask is 
		actually edited
